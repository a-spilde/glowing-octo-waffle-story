There once was a lion named Leo.  He lived in Sub-Saharan Africa and was theking if 
his land. Everyday he woke up and roamed his lands looking for prey to feed his 
family. One day, however, he noticed something strange happening. What is it that 
dares to challenge the lion?

None other than the Susy the Snake, she was the largest snake in Africa. She came from
the thick Rainforest of the Congo. She traveled all the way to Leo to challenge him to 
a fight.
