There once was a lion named Leo.  He lived in Sub-Saharan Africa and was the king of his land. Everyday he woke up and roamed his lands looking for 
prey to feed his family. One day, however, he noticed something strange happening. What is it that dares to challenge the lion?

None other than the Susy the Snake, she was the largest snake in Africa. She came from the thick Rainforest of the Congo. She traveled all the way to 
Leo to challenge him to a fight.

Despite the peace-loving nature of Leo, the fight was unevitable. It took place one afternoon and all other animals living nearby came to see this 
happen. Leo was reluctant to attack Susy, so all he did was merely defense. It happened instantly when Leo was blinded by a ray of sun and Susy wrapped 
around his neck. "This is for my dead father!" Susy yelled in anger

Leo could feel his life slowly slipping away. This might be his end. Suddenly, thoughts of his children came rushing to his head.  He need to survive 
for them! He used all the energy he had to defend one last time. He wrestled Suzy off and ended her.  Leo would never forget this moment for the rest 
of his life, gaining a new found respect for the little things in life.

THE END!
